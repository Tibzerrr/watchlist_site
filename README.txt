The site consists of a banner with different options and a body which shows the different movies.
When clicking on a movie image, it displays information about the movie in a pannel in the middle of the screen.
You can put filters in the banner to match your desire at the moment for a specific movie.
You can add movies by searching a movie in the search bar. When doing so, the website searches for a match in the IMDB website and extract the main information, and displays it in the middle of the screen.
You can choose to add this movie to your personal watchlist so you can have the information at anytime.
One of the main feature is also to be able to mark a movie as "already watched" or "not watched".

The site needs a local server in order to work, as well as a database, I personally used "WampServer" and "phpmyadmin".
The site needs a database to work, so in order to install it, you need to create a database in phpmyadmin and run the code from the file "movie_data.sql".
In order to make the database work, you need to change the identifier, the password and the database name from phpmyadmin to yours in the file "config.php".
